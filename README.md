# Information Bottleneck
This toolbox enables users to calculate various information theoretic bounds.

The toolbox can compute the following:
* Renyi and Shannon Entropy 
* Shannon Mutual Information
* Kullback-Leibler Divergence of two distributions
* Matrix of Kullback-Leibler Divergences corresponding to two conditional distributions
* Information Bottleneck (IB) bound for X given a parameter beta (as defined by Tishby et. al.)
* IB curve for X (as defined by Tishby et. al.)

This toolbox will soon be able to compute:
* Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for X given a parameter beta (as defined by Strauss et. al.)
* DIB curve for X (as defined by Strauss et. al.)

Furthermore, this is Adan Moran-MacDonald's NSERC USRA project with Dr. Fady Alajaji at Queen's University.
